# cs61aApp
App for CS61A at UC Berkeley

## Purpose
This Android App will help the many students taking CS61A keep track of homeworks, labs, and projects throughout the semester.

## Features 
The app contains a countdown timer for each assignment and notifies users of open assignments or assignments that are nearing the due date. 
The assignments are contained in a scrollable CardView. 

## Future Adaptibility
Eventually we want to adapt this application for courses such as CS61B, EE16A, and EE16B. The only distinction will be the parsing of each course's website to gather information about assignments.
