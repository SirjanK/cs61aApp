# cs61aApp
App for CS61A UC Berkeley

This application will provide a platform for CS 61A students in the University of California at Berkeley to navigate the course website and receive updates on new assignments. The course is taught by the dope professor, John Denero. 

##Settings
Users will be able to set the time intervals they want to receive updates if anything has changed. A change would be if a new assignment is added. Assignments include Hws, projects, quizzes, labs, and discussions. There will also be a notification some time (set by the user) before the assignment is due unless that assignment is checked off.
